# Minimum Viable Governance

## What is Minimum Viable Governance?

Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) - currently in beta - is a repository-based
approach for putting lightweight governance into free and open source projects
that are run in version control systems. It provides an overall two-tier
organizational governance structure for a set of free and open source projects.
At the top level (called an "organization" on GitHub), there is a technical
steering committee to make decisions about the overall direction and
coordination between all the organization's projects. Underneath that top level
are the individual projects, with lightweight, consensus-based governance.

There are two folders. The first, org-docs, provides top-level organizational
governance and policies for a technical steering committee (TSC). The second
folder, project-docs, provides a template for individual project governance,
subject to the policies and oversight of the larger organization.

Minimum Viable Governance is meant as a way to quickly stand up collaborations
that can grow with your organization and projects. If your organization grows to
the point where a corporate home becomes necessary, typically when your
organization begins holding money, MVG is designed to make that transition easy.

## Why would we want to use this?

Minimum Viable Governance allows you to start an organization and sub-projects
with simple governance in place at the outset - including legal terms, licensing
and trademark issues, and due process. Having this governance in place early
helps avoid disputes among participants down the road.

## How do we use this?

1. Review the documents and determine if this is right for you.
2. Describe the organization's mission in Section 1 of the
   [CHARTER.md](org-docs/CHARTER.md) file.
3. Put the org-docs in a repository for the organization's governance and have
   each initial TSC member "sign" the
   [STEERING-COMMITTEE.md](org-docs/STEERING-COMMITTEE.md) file by adding their
   name and organizational affiliation (if applicable) to the file.
4. For each project that will be under your organization's governance, create a
   repository under the organization and have each initial maintainer "sign" the
   [MAINTAINERS.md](project-docs/MAINTAINERS.md) file by adding their name and
   affiliation (if applicable) to the file.
5. [Choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/) or fill out the copyright
   information in the MIT [LICENSE.md](project-docs/LICENSE.md) file for each
   project.
6. Get to work.
